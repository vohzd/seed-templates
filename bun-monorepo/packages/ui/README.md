Note, this is just for Vue components atm, could possibly be extended in the future for react (so a core package, vue, react etc)

## why not use x?

- i wanted to learn
- i wanted a table component with advanced sorting baked in (not keen on the other ones out there)
- i wanted a sliding component with smoth animations (and also to learn)
